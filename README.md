<h3>A custom game engine created from scratch in C++ using OpenGL.</h3>

<p>This includes GLSL shader support for dynamic lighting (ambient, diffuse, and specular) and multiple light sources, algorithms to generate multiple different types of terrain (the images above show fractal-generated mountains and hills, respectively), and an intuitive object rendering system that handles both static and dynamic objects.

A previous version of this game engine created in Java using <a href="https://www.lwjgl.org/">LWJGL</a> and the <a href="http://jbullet.advel.cz/">JBullet Physics Library</a> also includes a customizable object UI and real-time physics that can be used to simulate complicated collisions.</p>
